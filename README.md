## What I Learned

- **Semantic HTML**: Learned how to use HTML tags properly for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Layouts**: Mastered techniques like Flexbox and media queries for responsive design.
- **Version Control**: Strengthened my Git/GitHub skills by managing commits and branches effectively.

## Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the layout adapted to smaller screens was challenging. Solved by learning and using media queries.
- **Button Placement**: Aligning the "I’m Feeling Lucky" button correctly without JavaScript required CSS experimentation.

## Next Steps

- **JavaScript Integration**: Add interactivity like the "I’m Feeling Lucky" functionality.
- **API Integration**: Explore integrating Google Search APIs to fetch real-time results.
- **Deployment**: Host the project on GitHub Pages for public access.
